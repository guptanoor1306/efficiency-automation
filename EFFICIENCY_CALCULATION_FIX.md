# Efficiency Calculation Fix - Product Team

## Issue Summary
The Product team's efficiency calculations were inconsistent between the weekly data entry view and the Company View > Weekly View, causing displayed efficiency percentages to not match.

## Root Cause
The Product team uses **story points** (like the Tech team) but with an automatic target of **1 SP per effective working day**. However, the code in two places didn't explicitly recognize Product as a story-points team:

1. **Finalization** (`finalizeWeeklyReport` function)
2. **Company View** (`getTeamWeeklyData` function)

Both places had Product team falling into the "else" block for "standard teams" which, while mathematically equivalent, didn't have explicit logging and could cause confusion.

## Team Types & Efficiency Formulas

### Story Points Teams:

**Tech Team** (Manual Target):
```javascript
efficiency = (completed_story_points / (target_points * effective_working_days / working_days)) * 100
```
- Uses manual `target_points` input field
- Adjusts target based on leave days

**Product Team** (Automatic Target):
```javascript
efficiency = (completed_story_points / effective_working_days) * 100
```
- Automatic target: 1 SP per effective working day
- No manual input needed

### Days Equivalent Teams:
All other teams (B2B, Varsity, Zero1, Audio, Shorts, Graphics, Pre-production, Content, Social):
```javascript
efficiency = (total_days_equivalent / effective_working_days) * 100
```
- Work is converted to days using `perDay` rates
- Example: 20 OST / 20 OST per day = 1 day

## Changes Made

### 1. Finalization Logic (Line 6637-6649)
**Before:** Product team fell into generic "else" block
**After:** Product team now has explicit handling:

```javascript
} else if (this.currentTeam === 'product') {
    // Product team: story points with automatic 1 SP/day target
    efficiency = effectiveWorkingDays > 0 ? (output / effectiveWorkingDays) * 100 : 0;
    
    console.log(`✅ Product finalization calculation for ${member.name}:`, {
        completedPoints: output,
        effectiveWorkingDays: effectiveWorkingDays,
        automaticTarget: effectiveWorkingDays,
        efficiency: efficiency.toFixed(1) + '%',
        'Formula': 'story_points / effective_working_days * 100'
    });
}
```

### 2. Company View Logic (Line 11929-11936)
**Before:** Product team fell into generic "else" block
**After:** Product team now has explicit handling:

```javascript
} else if (teamId === 'product') {
    // Product team: story points with automatic 1 SP/day target
    efficiency = effectiveWorkingDays > 0 ? (memberOutput / effectiveWorkingDays * 100) : 0;
    
    console.log(`✅ Product Company View: ${memberOutput}/(${effectiveWorkingDays}*1) = ${memberOutput}/${effectiveWorkingDays} = ${efficiency.toFixed(1)}%`);
    console.log(`   Formula: story_points / effective_working_days * 100`);
}
```

## Verification

### Weekly Data Entry:
Already had correct calculation for Product team (Line 5259-5305):
```javascript
} else if (this.currentTeam === 'product') {
    adjustedTarget = effectiveWorkingDays * 1; // 1 SP per effective working day
    efficiency = adjustedTarget > 0 ? (weekTotal / adjustedTarget) * 100 : 0;
}
```

### Data Output:
The `calculateMemberTotalOutput` function already correctly returns story points for Product team (Line 5866):
```javascript
if (this.currentTeam === 'tech' || this.currentTeam === 'product') {
    // For Tech/Product teams: return raw story points (no conversion to days)
    totalOutput += workDone; // Direct story points, no division
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ **Consistency**: All three calculation points now explicitly handle Product team
- ✅ **Clarity**: Console logs now clearly show Product team calculations
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Efficiency values will now match between Weekly Entry and Company View
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Future developers will clearly see Product team's special handling

## Testing Recommendations
1. Fill a weekly report for Product team for October 2025 Week 1
2. Verify efficiency shown in the weekly entry form
3. Go to Company View > Weekly View > October Week 1
4. Verify the same efficiency is displayed for Product team members
5. Check console logs to see explicit "Product Company View" calculation messages

## Related Teams
No changes needed for:
- **Tech Team**: Already properly handled with manual target points
- **All Other Teams**: Correctly use days-equivalent calculation

## Date
Fixed: October 8, 2025
